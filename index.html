            <p>We believe children should stay children as long as they need and the fact that they enter <br> 1st grade should not end their childhood. We intertwine playing and learning at such an <br> early age and encourage our students to enjoy learning.

            <h1 class="about">about us</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">We began as a visionary venture in 1998 when Dr. Gabriel and Alish Black, world-class academics in the field of economics, endeavored to find a way to prepare students for college and the real world better than schools did at the time. They quickly found that the best way to make students thrive was simple: challenge them. After opening their first school in 1998, the Blocks discovered that students, when given a well-crafted curriculum and teachers who truly cared about teaching it, were able to learn at exceedingly high levels, meeting and surpassing the best students in the world. What began as a single campus has grown to become a unique, high-achieving, and unprecedented network of schools.
